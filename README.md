## Dual Grid Tilemap System For Godot In GDScript

A converted version of [jess::codes' C# dual grid system repo](https://github.com/jess-hammer/dual-grid-tilemap-system-godot) into native GDScript.

Using a dual grid system has the following advantages:
- Only 16 (or 6) tiles are required in the tileset
- The tiles have perfectly rounded corners
- The tiles align to the world grid
